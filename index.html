						<p class="mt-2 justify">
							This might not be completely right, or you might disagree—I'm just sharing my thoughts.
						</p>
						
						<p class="mt-3 justify">
							Many people think that all great scientists and successful people started with nothing. They imagine stories like the famous one about Thomas Edison studying under streetlights at night. But that's not the full picture! There are so many talented people who never get a fair chance because of difficult circumstances, but we don't see them—we only notice the few exceptions. (And even then, conditions 50 years ago can't be compared to today.)
						</p>
						
						<p class="mt-3 justify">
							When I started university, I came from a small town in Isfahan, and honestly, I didn't have great conditions before that. I remember telling a close friend: "We're definitely going to end up at the bottom with the worst grades!" :) Because there were only about 2 or 3 students whose situation was worse than ours—everyone else had much better situation.
						</p>
						
						<p class="mt-3 justify">
							But I was wrong. I came to believe that people who study through hardship and climb their way up rarely fall behind—they almost always keep improving (I haven't seen anyone who didn't). But I've seen the opposite many times: people who studied with every advantage and still dropped significantly in university. (Though many of them also do amazingly well—and maybe what I'm about to say is for them.) Maybe it's because someone who fought hard doesn't want to lose what they've earned.
						</p>
						
						<p class="mt-3 justify">
							In Iran, there's a national entrance exam for universities. Statistics show that a very, very small percentage of students who get into top universities come from middle-class or lower backgrounds—most are from wealthy families.
						</p>
						
						<p class="mt-3 justify">
							Does this mean people without resources shouldn't try? Absolutely not. They must keep trying. But the point is: those who have the ability to help should help those with fewer opportunities—to make our world a bit more fair. I have many friends at great universities like MIT, Stanford, Berkeley—brilliant people. But I also have friends who don't have good conditions, who are honestly more talented than anyone I know. And I'm sure that if they had the same opportunities, in 10 years they'd be way ahead of many others.
						</p>
						
						<p class="mt-3 justify">
							My point is: if you're someone who has something to give and can help someone with less, please do! It's not always easy, but sometimes it's possible. For example, if you're a professor, pay attention—did this student go from 1 to 70, or from 60 to 80? It will benefit you too!
						</p>
						
						<p class="mt-3 justify">
							I don't mean to offend anyone with this post. I just feel that too many people give up because conditions aren't fair (and I don't mean excuses—I mean real unfairness), and too much talent is being wasted. Sometimes you have to ask yourself: How do I know? Maybe if this person had the same opportunities, they would have done so much more...
